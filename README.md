<h3>Remark</h3>
No examples of input data were provided.<br> 
So, I referred to the context of the task:<br>
- student is unable to repair many laptops during the summer,
- the price of a laptop and the profit that can be made from its sale are not related.<br>
(a cheaper laptop can bring more profit than a more expensive one)<br>
(this is due to the degree of the laptop's malfunction).<br>
In accordance with these points, I decided not to complicate the application with more complex data structures and additional sorts.
